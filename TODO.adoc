## What would I still like to add to this toolset?

- Support for playlist IDs
- built-in support and instructions for importing your https://takeout.google.com/takeout/custom/youtube[YouTube Google Data Takeout archives], so you can browse and filter your subscriptions, playlists, likes, comments and watch history.
- export functions
- Optional YouTube V3 API support
	- Could use this to retrieve metadata such as channel name and video title for video IDs
	- sync subscriptions / playlists
	- "Like" and/or "Favourite" after watching a video
- Add channel by video ID
- Easy way to update all your feeds, or just the most used ones.
- Indicator for feeds with new entries
- store twitch feeds

## What would I like to change?

- Have a single consolidated menu that uses `execute-silently` rather than launch another fzf menu with the output from the first menu.
- Have the menu display just the channel/feed names, and use key binds to switch between date/title/etc sort orders.
