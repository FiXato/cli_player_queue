# CLI Player Queue

## What is CLI Player Queue?
A set of scripts to retrieve the title of the media launched with the CLI tool, track it in a history file, browsing and filtering the player history using fzf (command-line fuzzy finder), and launching the player (usually mpv) with the results.

## Why?
Because I don't have enough pet projects already. ;)
Nah, just to simplify finding and re-opening videos (mostly YouTube and Twitch) I've watched through MPV from the command-line.

## Usage examples:

### Get title for YouTube video:
```
./get_title_from_url.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwVWDLxWx2U
#=> FiXato -  FiXato's View - About FiXato's channel
```

### Track video to history file, and open it:
`./play_video.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwVWDLxWx2U`

The history file `$PLAY_VIDEO_HISTORY_FILE` now contains:
`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwVWDLxWx2U # FiXato -  FiXato's View - About FiXato's channel`

### Re-open video by title:
`./play_video.sh "FiXato's View"`
Should re-open https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwVWDLxWx2U if it was found in the history file. If it was not found, it thinks the title is actually the URL though, and MPV will fail...

### Browse the history file and play the selected media file:
`./play_video.sh`
This will open `fzf` with the history file, which will allow you to browse through the entire list, line by line:
```

and optionally filter as you type:
```

```

## Future plans:

* A script to populate a `$MEDIA_SUBSCRIPTIONS_FILE` with media URLs and titles from your YouTube subscriptions and perhaps recent videos from Twitch streamers you follow, as well as a toggle for the `play_video.sh` script to browse these instead of the `$PLAY_VIDEO_HISTORY_FILE`

## Dependencies:

* https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[fzf] FuzZy Finder, a command-line tool for presenting a list of options, and returning the selected item as a string
* https://github.com/KEINOS/gofeed-cli#Download[GoFeed-CLI], a command-line client to retrieve RSS feeds and transform them into a JSON object.
* https://github.com/ericchiang/pup/[pup], a command-line HTML parser using CSS-paths.
* `grep`, preferably GNU's grep, rather than BSD's grep.
* `ripgrep` aka `rg` for the `youtube.sh grep` command.
* recode: an optional CLI tool the script *can* use for translating HTML entities to UTF-8. If not found, it won't try to decode the HTML entities.


## Changelog:

* Version 1, 2021-01-07:
** Initial release:
*** Script (`get_title_from_url.sh`) to retrieve the title of a YouTube video, as well as from a HTML page (if it has a <title> element).
*** Script (`play_video.sh`) to play the given media URL with $PLAYER (default: mpv), track it in $PLAY_VIDEO_HISTORY_FILE (default: ~/.config/play_video_history.log), and re-open media from the history file.
